miscela
=====================================
`miscela` is an openFrameworks app i use to mix GLSL fragment shaders in realtime. This repo also contains snippets of GLSL code and the shaders i'm working on at the time.

The code in this repository will change as the water flows, don't be attached to it =) 

For Lua scripting i'm using [nanovg](https://github.com/memononen/nanovg) binded with the help of [ofxLua](https://github.com/danomatika/ofxLua), that i just tweaked a bit. Some of the binded code also takes insperation from Satoru Higa's [ofxNanoVG](https://github.com/satoruhiga/ofxNanoVG).
